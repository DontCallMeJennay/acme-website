# ACME Device Company website
A full-stack (MERN) demo project with a silly sense of humor. This is the front half.

### TODO next
* Add details to the page components - finalize what I want the site to do
* Go back to DB schema and determine data and search options
* Research and add content/flavor/whatever
* On the back end, finish the database setup and figure out authentication
